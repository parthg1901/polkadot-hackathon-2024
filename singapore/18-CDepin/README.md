## Introduction

The content delivery network (CDN) is an important infrastructure that underpins the global internet access experience today. However, the challenges of scalability, cost efficiency, and data privacy faced by traditional technologies are becoming increasingly severe. The rise of Web3.0 has driven a new wave of decentralized CDN development, but the existing solutions have problems such as high technical and hardware thresholds, overly complex protocols, non-transparent proof-of-work, limited functionality, and poor scalability.

This project aims to provide a new decentralized CDN solution by establishing an open, cross-platform, and scalable resource value network through a set of concise smart contract protocols. This allows more devices to join the network in a simpler way, contribute services, and receive fair and transparent rewards.

Furthermore, this project also supports nodes to freely join different working protocols and plug in various functional modules to unlock the value of physical or virtual resources such as bandwidth, memory, and CPU computing power, enabling the decentralized CDN to expand its capabilities in areas like data encoding and decoding, edge computing, and real-time content delivery.

## Architect
The project realizes the matching of different resource providers and users through a series of concise smart contract work protocols. It uses an order mechanism to indirectly measure the work volume of nodes, and calculates and release rewards based on the work volume.

To prevent Sybil attacks, an NFT token access mechanism is used to control the number of specific service nodes, and node registration staking are used to increase the cost of attacks. To prevent generative attacks, rewards are delayed in being released to prevent nodes from flooding in a large number of orders to obtain more rewards, and nodes can only receive positive earnings when providing services to others.

Initially, nodes utilize trial services to attract users, and gradually establish stable credit relationships between resource providers and users. This allows service users to choose which providers to cooperate with, thereby eliminating the complex and easy-to-centralize scheduling mechanism.
